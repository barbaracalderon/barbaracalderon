Former Internationalist with a Master's Degree in International Relations, and a focus on International Political Economy, I leverage skills such as communication, analytical thinking, strategic problem-solving, and formal academic research to navigate technical challenges and apply solutions in software development. 

I am a technology enthusiast and a fast, adaptive learner. I have a passion for documentaries, purpose-driven organizations, black coffee, science-fiction movies, pesto sauce, macadamia and brazilian nuts, occasional gym sessions, and the community experience. I thoroughly enjoy translating ideas into code.
